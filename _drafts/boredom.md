title: Boredom
categories: zen

Boredom is the deeply unpleasant state of unmet arousal; where we are aroused rather than despondent, but, for one or more reasons, our arousal cannot be met or directed. These reasons can be internal - often a lack of imagination, motivation or concentration - or external, such as an absence of environmental stimuli or opportunities.

We want something engaging, but find ourselves unable to do so and, more than that, are frustrated by the arising awareness of this inability.

This is most common in children, who in addition to being chaperoned, lack the mind furnishing - the resources, experience and discipline - to mitigate their boredom.

Why is is so damned boring to be stuck in a departure lounge whie our flight is increasingly delayed?

Lack of control of our environment and anticipation

If life were intrinsically meaningful or fulfilling, there could be no such thing as boredom.

Boredom then is the evidence of the meaninglessness of life, opening the shutters on some very uncomfortable feelings that we normally block out with flurry of activity or with opposite feelings.

> I knew a man who gave 20 years of his life to a scatterbrained woman, sacrificing everything to her, his friendships, his work, the very respectability of his life, and who one evening recognised that he had never loved her. He had been bored, that's all, bored like most people. Hence he had made himself out of whole cloth a life full of complications and drama. Something must happen - and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen, even loveless slavery, even war or death.

Out in the real world, we expend considerable resources on combatting boredom. The value of the global entertainment and media market is set to reach $2.6 trillion by 2023, and entertainers and athletes are afforded ludicrously high levels of pay and status. The technological advances of recent years have put an eternity of entertainment at our fingertips, but this has made matters only worse -  in part, by removing us further from our here and now.

Instead of feeling sated and satisfied, we are desensitised and in need of ever more stimulation - ever more war, ever more gore, and ever more hardcore.

The good news is that boredom can also have upsides. Boredom can be our way of telling ourselves that we are not spending out time as well as we should.
