title: 'Daily UI :: 001 Sign Up'

This UI challenge was straight-forward. Create a sign up flow for anything that you want. So I decided upon Roll-Box, a much needed toilet-paper-subscription-box service. Want to hoard some cylinders in your fallout shelter? Want to build a paper fort? Want to TP somebody's house? Why not subscribe to Roll-Box today. Simply type in the promo code: FREETP 

In any case, here is what the UI looks like:
