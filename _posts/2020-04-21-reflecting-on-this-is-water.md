title: 'Reflecting on: This Is Water'

In the speech titled This Is Water, David Foster Wallace suggests a nascent idea of what the point is: 

> It is about making it to 30 or maybe 50 without wanting to shoot yourself in the head. It is about simple awareness â€” the awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us , that we have to keep reminding ourselves, over and over: "This is water, this is water".

The speech contains one idea that I keep with me:

## Avoid The Default-Setting

Because we only experience the world through our perspective, hence, by default, we perceive the world as though we are the center of it; The Default-Setting. 

This Default-Setting is seen when we respond to our our experiences based on our innate self-centered lens. It is the simple obedience to the constant monologue in our heads. 

We avoid the Default-Setting by being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. And it involves attention, awareness, discipline and effort to truly care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in a myriad of petty, little and unsexy ways, every day.

> The true value of the liberal arts education is: How to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default-setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone, day in, and day out.
