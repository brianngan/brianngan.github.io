title: 'How to do better Retrospectives? '

I hate retrospectives. It's an expensive and time-wasting meeting. You spend a minute cherry-picking a story in your head; just like how you would come up with an Instagram caption: i.e. you find a balanced and positive message. And then once that's done, you just stare into blank space, wait for your turn, say your story, and then return to that spot on the wall.

I think the right place for these styles of conversation are in therapy, church cell group, self-help workshops, etc. It's different at work. The workplace is a more political, judgmental and professional. As much as we pretend that it is a 'team' or a 'family'; it is inherent when a manager pays a salary for deliverables that politics is needed to compare worth, judgement is needed to determine performance and professionalism is needed to justify the salary. It is just work. When you layer judgement, politics and professionalism, what you get is an inevitable censorship that immediately makes retrospectives useless.

It's just work. Retrospectives will always lead to a variation of the following: a pedestal to humble-brag. Lip service. An award ceremony (_thank you everybody_). Only obviously known and surface problems will be aired. A veiled blame game. A blatant blame game.

The exception to this will be staff or managers who probably don't understand the dynamics at play and are being overly earnest to share.

## I hate retrospectives too? What can I do instead?

If you are a manager that feels this way. Good. It's your job to stop retrospectives and start doing your job of listening to and engaging with your employees. Employees will have things that block their progress and affect their motivation. Knowing just enough to address these issues is part of your responsibility to the team and the company.

The reality is that teams will air their grievances and celebrate their successes in their own way. On a private slack channel, over a beer, or during lunch. Those are the real retrospectives. You may be in some of those conversations, but by default, you will never (and should not aspire to be) in all of these conversations.

If you are a team member that feels this way, I empathize with your predicament. You can join the silent protest by going to my random retrospective response generator at [link](/404.html "link"). Let's stand together is silent protest by offering more generic and plain-bread responses to quietly let the world know about the white-office superficiality of the retrospective.
