Building inwardly refers to building internal tools for operations, finance, sales and other peripheral teams to use. My opinion is that there are only a few good reasons to build an internal tool:

> Not having it causes a bottleneck of a revenue channel.  
> Not having it blocks the ability to make a key decision.

I find myself increasingly inundated by feature requests to build more internal tools, some times at the expense of user-facing features.
