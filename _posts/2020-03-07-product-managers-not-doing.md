title: 'Product Managers: Not-doing'
categories: product

---
I know that a good product manager is one who can work with people to build and iterate on things. A good product manager can **do things** - i.e. she executes well, communicates well and overcomes obstacles well. Asking questions to understand how a potential hire builds a feature helps:

* Can she zoom in and out of detail,
* Can she articulate the problem and solution, and
* Can she come up with reasonable solutions to obstacles?

In business, there is a default bias towards **doing things**. Doing things is proof of work to the management. Doing things satiates our need to preoccupy our minds. Doing things keeps others busy. This bias turns into a problem when the things we build become slowly lose reason. This almost always leads to feature bloat or white elephants.

However, a product is not just the sum of the features built. A product is also the negative space around it; **things not done**.

In a sense, I want to reframe the idea of **not doing**. It should not be passive inactivity, but rather a deliberate and active **not-doing**. 

**Not-doing** is a lot of work for it's namesake. **Not-doing** is being able to reject senior stakeholder ideas. **Not-doing** is resisting your urges to doing obvious but wrong things, in favour of less wrong things.
