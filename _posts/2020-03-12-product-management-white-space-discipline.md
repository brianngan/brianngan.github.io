White space _(or negative space)_ is a photography term to describe the empty space of a photo. This empty space allows for three things: clear composition, breathing room, and subject emphasis.

In product, the white space is the invisible list of features that a product manager does not build.

## White Space Discipline in Product

White space discipline is self-evident when done right:

**Clear composition**: The product efficiently solves a self-evident _(well-defined)_ problem.  
**Breathing room**: The product does not have bloated and unused features.   
**Subject emphasis**: The product naturally draws the user to the core solution.

In practice, it is culling peripheral problems in favor of problems whose solutions move the primary metrics. This means having to refocus yourself and the team on the few things that we want to really do right

White space is imposing strong constraints on designs, iterating on what works and rejecting what does not. For untested new features, it is having a sense of the minimum feature set to design as MVP. For more mature feature sets, it is iterating and proactively removing features that work less well. None of these are interesting as standalone designs. There is always a more intriguing and fully-realised way to design. There is always another more novel project on the horizon. There is always enough space on the website to leave a bad feature as it is. 

That being said, the reward of having white space discipline would be a better shot at building something that users are intuitively drawn to because it clearly solves their problem, is simple and is clearly solving their problem.
