## TL;DR

**The Original Challenge** 

To monetize the news organisation's wealth of archive photographs. I worked on discovering the right audience and meaningful problems to solve. The product discovery led to...

**The Product**

Photonico - a stock photography product with an emphasis on Asian culture and community. I was the product manager that worked with a team of developers, designers and librarians at Singapore Press Holdings to bring the product to market and find revenue sources. This resulted in...

**The Outcome**

We achieved several revenue-generating content marketing partnerships with government organisations, grew the community to hundreds of photo contributors, and grew traffic to 10,000s of monthly users.  We also made archival photos internally available to SPH staff.

## Overview

The opportunity that came from working in a news organisation was its deep archives of news content. The deep wealth of high quality archival photographs could potentially address meaningful problems in Singapore. My task was to discover the right problem and audience to create a product around. 

My Chief Product Officer coached me and was instrumental in defining the product vision and strategy. 

## Product Discovery

My initial weeks involved speaking with a wide group of related audience types such as Photographers, Creatives, Librarians, etc. I decided to address the legitimate problem of finding good asian-centric stock photography. In general, competitors like Shutterstock, Getty Images or Unsplash have a very western-centric aesthetic. This means that most Singaporean creatives and marketers do private photo shoots in order to achieve the desired look and feel.

When shown some archival photos, I found that they fit a very narrow use case for creatives and marketers. This means that the success of the product would be contingent on bringing in the right set of photography that meets the broader use case of creatives and marketers.

With this primary problem statement, we built a stock photography MVP and used the wealth of archival photos as a start, prior to getting more photo contributions.

## Challenges

Nested in the idea of a stock photography product were a few unique challenges:

* Content Discovery and Recommendation
* Licensing and Pricing Model
* Photography Contribution and Royalties Model

Each of these topics would be worth an article.
