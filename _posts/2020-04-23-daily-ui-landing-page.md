Today's UI challenge was to create a landing page. I created **Outside**, the biggest social media platform in the world where you sign up by ... going outside (Aside: please stay at home if you are quarantined or on lock down).

For the competitive analysis, I found a good and relevant design resource ([landingfolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/inspiration/landing-page?offset=2 "landingfolio inspiration")). You should check out if you want to see how others do landing pages.

A landing page can be distilled down into three components: Action, Value Preview and Social Proof. Below, I go into detail for each of the components. This was how I incorporated the 3 components:

## Action

All good landing pages have one and only one action. I judge how good a product onboarding is by its efficiency in guiding the user to experience the core value proposition of the product. In the same way, I judge a good landing page by the efficiency of that action button. Of course, this translates to clickthru and bounce rates.

It really depends on what is being sold as a product, what is the core value proposition. For software, particularly node modules, I like it when the landing page's action is the code snippet to initialise the module. That would be the quickest way for a developer to try out the experience of the module. For SAAS, I like demos or sandboxes, where the user can go from the landing page to trying out the service in one quick step. Sign up with email is a good enough catch-all for many use cases.

## Value Preview

Value preview is presenting the user with just enough information to understand the product. This is particularly contentious to create, because stakeholders will have different views on what should be previewed. It is always a question of weighing (1) what you think that your user knows about you, (2) what is the core attractive value and when is the information too much. And everybody in your team will have a different opinion of the three answers.

For (1), you can imagine the extreme example of being Instagram, where everybody knows your product. In that case your landing page would have no real need for value preview and probably a gif of scrolling through the feed would suffice.

For (2), it is the concise elevator pitch to say what your product does for the user. 

## Social Proof

Social proof is quite important for B2B products in particular. The defacto purchasing manager of a company is often poorly equipped to understand what a prospective product is good for and whether it should be used. Telling them that a big brand uses the product is a strong and convenient way to persuade from authority.

## Style

This style was very minimal and enjoyable to use. My Whites were purely reserved for the window and for the form input field. Both of which I deem as the key visual and informational elements of the page. Colours were extremely easy to work with. 

I wonder how it would be like to work on a red brand? Like a Carousell, Youtube and, to a lesser extent, Airbnb. Wouldn't the reds clash with the danger alerts or the danger delete buttons? Maybe that would be worth practising in a future challenge.
