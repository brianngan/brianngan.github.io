As a non-design design practitioner (lol.), I get asked from time to time to evaluate designs or to come up with designs of my own. I find it useful to have a general definition of good UI design. And it looks like this:

>Program Model = User Model ?

The equation is trivially simple: "Is the experience (*program model*) what the user expects (*user model*)?" 

For example: in a banking app, a user wants to transfer money. He has a few expectations that serves as his mental model. This model is roughly based on:
- Similar Experiences: He has used other apps.
- Real World Experiences: He has gone to a bank to make a transfer.
  
This means that the user would have a prior understanding of normal login flows, how a transfer works and key transfer details to fill in. This set the precedence for the level of complexity that a banking app could have. 

Everyone has preconceived notions of how things are expected to work. And the more closely that your program represents those expectations, the more comfortable the experience will be.

## How Do I Know The User Model?

It turns out that most people share similar models of how software works. Go over to another department and ask people such as the marketing or finance staff. Usually, asking 5 people would uncover the most severe usability issues.

1. Describe the goal of the program.
2. Describe a task.
3. Show a prototype of the program.
4. Ask the user to think out loud and complete the task.
5. Observe and discover the mental model.
