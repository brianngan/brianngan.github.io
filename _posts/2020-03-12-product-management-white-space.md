White space _(or negative space)_ is a photography term to describe the empty space of a photo. This empty space allows for three things: clear composition, breathing room, and subject emphasis.

In product, the white space is the invisible list of features that a product manager does not build.

## White Space in Product

White space in product works on two planes: On the product itself, and on the product manager's influence on his stakeholders.

### Product White Space

Product white space is self-evident when done right:

**Clear composition**: The product efficiently solves a self-evident _(well-defined)_ problem.  
**Breathing room**: The product does not have bloated and unused features.   
**Subject emphasis**: The product naturally draws the user to the core solution.

In practice, it is culling peripheral problems in favor of problems whose solutions move the primary metrics. This means having to refocus yourself and the team on the few things that we want to really do right

White space is imposing strong constraints on designs, iterating on what works and rejecting what does not. For untested new features, it is having a sense of the minimum feature set to use as MVP. For more mature feature sets, it is iterating and proactively removing features that work less well. None of these are interesting as standalone designs. There is always a more novel and fully-realised design to build.

A good product manager proactively rejects requests, ideas or problems. The core role of the product manager is to help to curate the features that constitute a product.

In a sense, choosing a correct enough solution in terms of scope and fidelity

A big part of the product manager's job is to curate the features that a product builds. This defines how you and the development team spends their time. The general rule is to build good enough features and iterate over time. Implied in this general rule is that there are wrong features that may be built.

I believe that a good product manager should be primarily judged based on his ability to avoid building the wrong things. As product managers, we are uniquely positioned to help decide the right problems to tackle and the right solution (in terms of scope and fidelity) to develop.

I know that a good product manager is one who can work with people to build and iterate on things. A good product manager can **do things** - i.e. she executes well, communicates well and overcomes obstacles well. Asking questions to understand how a potential hire builds a feature helps:

* Can she zoom in and out of detail,
* Can she articulate the problem and solution, and
* Can she come up with reasonable solutions to obstacles?

In business, there is a default bias towards **doing things**. Doing things is proof of work to the management. Doing things satiates our need to preoccupy our minds. Doing things keeps others busy. This bias turns into a problem when the things we build become slowly lose reason. This almost always leads to feature bloat or white elephants.

However, a product is not just the sum of the features built. A product is also the negative space around it; **things not done**.

In a sense, I want to reframe the idea of **not doing**. It should not be passive inactivity, but rather a deliberate and active **not-doing**.

**Not-doing** is a lot of work for it's namesake. **Not-doing** is being able to reject senior stakeholder ideas. **Not-doing** is resisting your urges to doing obvious but wrong things, in favour of less wrong things.
