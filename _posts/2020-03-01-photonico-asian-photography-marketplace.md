### TL;DR

**The Original Challenge**

To monetize the news organisation's wealth of archive photographs. As the product manager, I worked on discovering the right audience and meaningful problems to solve. The product discovery led to...

**The Product**

Photonico - a stock photography product with an emphasis on Asian culture and community. I worked with a team of developers, designers and librarians at Singapore Press Holdings to bring the product to market and find revenue sources. This resulted in...

**The Outcome**

New revenue streams such as content marketing partnerships of over $100,000, creation of a new community of 100s of photo contributors, and traffic of over 10,000 of monthly users.

### Problem Definition

**User Research (Product Discovery)**

My initial two weeks involved speaking with a wide group of related audience types such as Photographers, Creatives, Librarians, etc. This process was integral in describing a persona and defining problems to solve.

The recurring problem raised by Creatives is the problem of finding good asian-centric stock photography. On the photographer end, the problem is on growing their personal brand for securing freelance gigs or other ways to sell their photos.

**Research Questions**

* When and why do you need to buy photos?
* How often do you buy photos and what are the common resources you use?
* What types of photos do you experience difficulty finding?
* What are you looking for in photos that you pay for?

**Research Findings**

* Users buy photos when creating artwork/website/advertisements for clients/inhouse
* Users have difficulty finding niche and asian photos for clients
* Users tend to feel that stock photo sites have complicated payments and pricing structures
* Users tend to use Google to search for images, being agnostic to the stock image website unless their company has a subscription plan.
* Users tend not to be the paying customer, payment is mete by the design manager or lead.
* Users look for photos with clean composition, relevant emotions and facial expressions. They also prefer the fashion and looks in photos to be contemporary.

**Competitors**

* Free images: Unsplash, Pexels, Burst by Shopify, Moose
* Paid images: Shutterstock, Getty Images, Adobe Stock, Pixerf, iStock

In general, competitors like Shutterstock, Getty Images or Unsplash have a very western-centric aesthetic. This means that most Singaporean creatives and marketers do expensive photo shoots in order to achieve the desired look and feel.

When shown some archival photos, I found that they fit a very narrow use case for creatives and marketers. This meant that the success of the product would be contingent on bringing in the right set of photography that meets the broader use case of creatives and marketers.

With this primary problem statement, we decided to build a stock photography MVP and used the wealth of archival photos as a base, and then work on getting relevant photo contributions.

**Persona**

Tom is an art director who frequently works with clients on Singapore/asian based marketing/microsite campaigns. He is tech savvy and particular about design. A pain point in his daily work is finding a relevant and high quality photo to use for his client’s campaign.

Carol is a news editor in a small publication and frequently files stories related to Southeast Asia. She understands social media and regularly acquires news from multiple sources. A pain point in her work is finding photos that capture a story since the publication’s reporters double up as photographers when in the field.

### Other Product Challenges

Nested in the idea of a stock photography product were a few unique challenges. I may cover these in separate articles:

* Content Discovery and Recommendation
* Licensing and Pricing Model
* Growing Photo Contributors and Royalties Model
* Tagging Workflows
