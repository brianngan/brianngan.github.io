      <h1><strong>Goodbye, things: On Minimalist Living</strong></h1>
        <h2>Fumio Sasaki</h2>
        <br>
        
        <p><strong>Why You Should Care</strong></p>
        <p>Because we have too many things and our relationship to things affect what we pay attention to, what we chase after, and what we spend our time doing. </p>
        <p>Product designers should care because minimalism is be meaningful approach to curating a tight set of features that users will appreciate. Adopting minimalism also improves decisiveness and encourages thoughtful reflection on the nature of things around you.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Big Idea </strong></p>
        <p>A minimalist is someone who knows what is truly important to himself. He gives important things the space to be important.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods of Minimalism</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Reduce things that you have multiples of.</li>
        <li>Remove things that you haven&rsquo;t used in a year.</li>
        <li>Remove if you have it for the sake of appearance.</li>
        <li>Take photos of things that have sentimental value to you. Then throw it away.</li>
        <li>Leave unused storage space empty. Storage is the nest for clutter.</li>
        <li>Let go of the idea of someday; the idea that one day you will reuse or fix something. It&rsquo;s better to cut those ties to your past and focus on today.</li>
        <li>Discard things that you have forgotten about.</li>
        <li>Let go of the sunk cost fallacy; of getting your money&rsquo;s worth.</li>
        <li>Avoid the habit of stocking up; keep one spare at most, but balance between storage and stocking need.</li>
        <li>Does this object make me happy? Or can I speak passionately about this object?</li>
        <li>Discard it if you have thought of doing it five times.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Benefits of Minimalism</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Attention spent thinking about those things. Things send silent messages.</li>
        <li>Visual distractions</li>
        <li>The ability to concentrate on being yourself. No need to compare and gather things for the sake of keeping up an appearance.</li>
        <li>Time spent cleaning</li>
        <li>Cost of living. Lower risk of doing things.</li>
        <li>Cost of moving. For most people it is prohibitively high.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why we don&rsquo;t throw things away?</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Is it because it&rsquo;s expensive?</li>
        <li>Are you ashamed that you will never make good use of this?</li>
        <li>Do you feel bad for the person who gave it to you?</li>
        <li>Does it feel like you are throwing away a fond memory that is attached to it?</li>
        <li>Is your vanity preventing you from throwing something away?</li>
        <li>Is it just easier to leave it where it is?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Gratitude</strong></p>
        <p>Gratitude is the only real competition to boredom. It allows a fresh perspective on things when we don&rsquo;t take them for granted. Contrast to getting bored to an old thing.</p>
        <p>Five Reflection Chant:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Reflect upon how the food has come before you - how the food might have been grown, prepared and brought to you as a meal</li>
        <li>Reflect upon your virtues and conduct. Are you worthy of the meal?</li>
        <li>Focus only on the mealin front of you without rushing through it and without thinking of any other thoughts.</li>
        <li>Eat not from a gourmet perspective, weighing whether the meal is tasty, but simply to support your life.</li>
        <li>Eat so you are able to pursue the objectives that you would like to achieve</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Other Ideas</strong></p>
        <p><em>Self-worth lies at the base of most of our actions. </em>We are social animals, we need other people to recognise our qualities to know that our life is worth living. People may want things for the sake of keeping up an appearance. We use objects to convey to people how valuable we are.</p>
        <p><em>The tool becomes the master.</em><em><br /></em>We become too reliant on using things to convey our value to others. We start collecting more things to feel more substantial. We spend more time in the act of caring for these things and become a slave to our belongings.</p>
        <p><em>Other sides of a thing </em>Owning a thing is a future and present obligation: Of time, space, freedom and energy. Energy in maintaining and keeping clean. Energy in cognitive effort &ldquo;the idea of someday&rdquo; and reminder every time you look at it.</p>
        <p><em>Spinoza</em>: When someone says that something is impossible, they have already decided that they don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
        <p><em>Homes are not museums</em></p>
        <p><em>Big items have big chain reactions. </em>A tv leads to a tv tabletop, leads to a set top box, a sofa, a coffee table.</p>
        <p><em>Free or cheap things have a cost </em>to cognitive attention, space and time.</p>
        <p><em>Guilt of owning things</em> Discarding can be a waste. But the guilt of hanging on to things and the attention allocated to those thoughts is the true waste.</p>
        <p><em>The desire to discard is the flip side of the coin of the desire to keep</em>. Don&rsquo;t make it a competition, a religion to espouse or a way to judge people.</p>
        <p><em>Give important things the space to be important.</em></p>
        <p><em>Tech</em>. Technology that compresses information into small devices and technology that overloads people with attention-grabbing information</p>
        <p><em>Boredom</em>. Why can&rsquo;t we help becoming bored of the things that we once desired? Your job, your clothes, your gadgets.</p>
