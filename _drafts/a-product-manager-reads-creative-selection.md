title: A Product Manager Reads Creative Selection
categories: product

---
Creative Selection describes Apple's product development process during the creation of Safari, Mail, iPhone and iPad. It was an approach that was characterised by prototype demos and feedback. 

Reading Creative Selection, Ken Kocienda, troubled me. **First, there were no product managers at Apple**. As a product manager, realising that the most vigorous and innovative phase of Apple, during the iPhone development, no product managers were involved. **Second, there were no distinct sprint cycles**. As a person who experiences sprint cycles like the sunrise and sunset, or ins and outs of tides, it is surreal. Instead, they used non-periodic demo showcases and 'convergence'. **Third, there were no usability tests or user interviews**; iPhone was developed in secret. So it really challenged me on a some meta level about my trajectory as a product manager.

**_No Product Managers Needed_**_._ Teams, consisting of dev and design team members, in Apple took a feature, i.e. iPhone keyboard, from r&d to deployment. No product managers were needed to write tickets, refine the backlog, prepare wireframes.
