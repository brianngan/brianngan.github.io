title: 'Taste: A Concept at Work Nobody Talks About'
categories: product

---
In the workplace, **taste** is an unspoken concept that underpins all business decisions. Words, in the form of explanations and design rationales, only go so far in capturing the thought processes behind the idea or approval. The rest is up to the manager or the employee's sense of taste. 

Ken Kocienda perceives taste as one of the seven elements essential to Apple's software success, and describes tastes as:

> Defining a refined sense of judgement and finding the balance that produces a pleasing and integrated whole.

Taste is an internalised opinion of the ideal: what is good and what is bad? This relates to all fields of business: Product, marketing, design, engineering, etc. 

A manager's taste dictates how time is spent in a meeting, it sets the agenda. For instance, a manager could devote 45 minutes of a meeting to nitpicking an internal powerpoint slide. In the same way, an employee's taste dictates how he spends his time in critical thinking.

Whether we are conscious of it or not, we use taste to refine the work that we do. We use taste to approve of other people's work. It is an innate process of self-correction. And that collective concept of taste -  it drives what is produced at the end of the day.

### Describing Dysfunction Through with Taste

**_Taste in Bad Faith._** In the hierarchical dynamics of the workplace, the default way of working is for employees to refine their work to suit their notion of the manager's taste. This is almost always acting in bad faith ([in the sartrean sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism))). It's the do-as-my-boss-says attitude to work, which is intellectually lazy and irresponsible. This is the default way. Occasionally, good outcomes happen because the manager has good taste anyway.

**_The Gaze of Other People on Taste._** The gaze ([also in the sartrean sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze)), i.e. how other people perceive us, directly affects our taste. In political workplaces, the gaze creates many forms of dysfunction. We may lower our heads and tailor our taste to fit in. We may choose to refine our work in a way that makes it flashier, so as to gain visibility.
