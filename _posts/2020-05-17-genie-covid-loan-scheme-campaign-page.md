## Working on a Tight Deadline

This campaign was put together in a less than a week by the product and product marketing teams. In response to the COVID-19 situation, Genie Financial Services quickly crafted a new Auto Financial Assistance Scheme to help small business and PHV drivers.

The short development time was crucial because we needed to capitalise on the press release and because of its immediate and unexpected nature.

I was the product manager of the campaign; working closely with the product marketing and business stakeholders to get the marketing copy and business rules to develop the page. In addition, I was the UX designer; designing the colour scheme and art style of the landing page and form.

All in all, while the landing pages and forms are a straightforward experience, it was an enjoyable as it allowed me to design something interesting and to create a channel to provide aid to small businesses.
