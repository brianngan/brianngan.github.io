A reminder on busyness and existence:

Laughter is the appropriate response to the busy person, Kierkegaard believes, for it is the perfect way to undercut his self-importance.

Indeed, busy people haughtily fill their time, always finding things to do - 'I just have so much on' - but this self-generated activity is simply a trivial means of escapism, Kierkegaard argues.

Such people block out their calendars to avoid confronting the general emptiness of their existences - to distract themselves from truly important questions, such as who they are and what their lives are for.

Everything matters but nothing matters: busy people are thus ridiculous.
