What makes good design? There is a common idea that good design is subjective, a matter of aesthetics, a matter of personal preference. This works fine, for the most part. 

However, in my area of software design, it helps me if I have a definition of good design that is more precise and practical. It helps my work; and gets me through my imposter syndrome complex.

## How Do I Know What Is Good Design?

As a non-design design practitioner (lol.), I get asked from time to time to evaluate designs or to come up with designs. I secretly use a simple frame to identify good design. It goes like this:

>Program Model = User Model ?

The equation is trivially simple. Expanding it, it questions: Is the experience (*program model*) what the user expects (*user model*)? 

For example: in a banking app, a user tries to transfer money. He has a few expectations that serves as his mental model. This model is roughly based on:

- Similar Experiences: He has used other apps.
- Real World Experiences: He has gone to a bank to make a transfer.

Everyone has preconceived notions of how things are expected to work. And the more closely that your program represents those expectations, the more comfortable the experience will be.

## How Do I Know The User Model?

It turns out that most people share similar models of how software works. Go over to another department and ask people such as the marketing or finance staff. Usually, asking 5 people would uncover the most severe usability issues.

1. Describe the goal of the program.
2. Describe a task.
3. Show a prototype of the program.
4. Ask the user to think out loud and complete the task.
5. Observe and discover the mental model.
