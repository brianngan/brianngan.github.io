title: A Product Manager Reads Creative Selection
categories: product

---
Creative Selection describes Apple's product development process during the creation of Safari, Mail, iPhone and iPad. It was an approach that was characterised by prototype demos and feedback.

Reading Creative Selection, Ken Kocienda, maddens me. **First, there were no product managers at Apple**. As a product manager, realising that the most vigorous and innovative phase of Apple, during the iPhone development, no product managers were involved; is a reason for me reflect on my career choice. **Second, there were no distinct sprint cycles**. As a person who experiences sprint cycles like the sunrise and sunset, or ins and outs of tides, it is surreal. Instead, they used non-periodic demo showcases and convergence. **Third, there were no usability tests or user interviews**; iPhone was developed in secret. So it really challenged me on a some meta level about my trajectory as a product manager.

**_No Product Managers Needed_**_._ Teams, consisting of dev and design team members, in Apple took a feature, i.e. iPhone keyboard, from r&d to deployment. No product managers were needed to write tickets, prioritise the backlog, prepare wireframes. I do not believe that my product management work is non-essential, so let me show you how I think the function of a product manager is delegated. First, a developer is made Directly Responsible Individual of a feature. This means he defines, prototypes, pitches, refines and debugs that feature. Prioritisation and manpower allocation logic, i.e. what and who to build, is defined at Scott Forstall, _SVP of Engineering_, and Steve Jobs level. In this sense, the work of a product manager is taken up by other existing roles.
