title: What's The Meaning Of Your Art?
categories: ux-design

---
"People often ask me, what is the meaning of your art or why."

"Well yknow art was the first invention right. There is a purpose to it, there has to be a purpose to it. I don't know what it is other than it might just be as simple as saying I'm here, which seems kinda shallow really, but maybe it is."

"Yknow hand prints on the cave wall. Is that saying   
"I'm here?"   
"I was here?" or   
"wow that's a really _cool_" (laughs). "Look at my hand _mannn_!". "
