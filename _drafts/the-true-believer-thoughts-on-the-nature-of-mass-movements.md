title: 'The True Believer: Thoughts On The Nature Of Mass Movements'
categories: philosophy

---
Readers have two ways of interpreting the book. The kind interpretation is that the book warns readers of the cyclical nature of social revolutions, religious movements and nationalist movements; to warn readers that the prerequisites of mass movements are always there. The less kind interpretation is that the book provides a play-by-play for creating your first cult.

In the latter sense, this book is a must-read for aspiring sociopathic cult leaders (or just regular sociopathic business leaders).

The description of the potential convert coincides with the postmodernist notion of a person who commits philosophical suicide; i.e. when a person who cannot deal with the Absurdity of the search for meaning and gives in to living in bad faith.
