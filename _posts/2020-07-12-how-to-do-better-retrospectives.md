title: 'How To Do Better Retrospectives? '

I hate Retrospectives. It’s an expensive and time-wasting meeting. I don't see real problems being aired and addressed. Rather, I see a lot of self-promotion and a pinch of git-blames going around. 

Here's how I sit through a Retrospective:  
I usually spend a few minutes cherry-picking a story in your head. Preferably striking a balanced between a positive note and a collectively-known problem facing the team. And then once that’s done, I just stare into blank space, wait my turn, say my story, and then return to that same spot on the wall.

I think the right place for these styles of conversation are in therapy, church cell group, self-help workshops, etc. The nature of work is just different. 

The workplace is a political, judgmental and professional. As much as we pretend that we are a ‘team’ or a ‘family’, once a manager pays a salary for deliverables, a power dynamic is created. By default, this creates the circumstances where politics is needed to compare relative worth, judgement is needed to determine performance and professionalism is needed to justify the salary. The nature of work is just different. Once you layer judgement, politics and professionalism, censorship becomes inevitable and that makes Retrospectives useless.

Retrospectives will tend towards this garden variation of topics: A pedestal to humble-brag. An award ceremony (_thank you so and so for this sprint's effort_). Lip service. Airing collectively-known and surface-level problems. A _veiled_ blame game. A _blatant_ blame game.

The exception to this will be staff or managers who probably don’t understand the dynamics at play and are being overly earnest to share.

## I hate Retrospectives too? What can I do instead?

If you are a manager that feels this way. Good. It’s your job to stop Retrospectives and start doing your job of listening to and engaging with your employees. Employees will have things that block their progress and affect their motivation. Knowing just enough to address these issues is part of your responsibility to the team and the company.

The reality is that teams will air their grievances and celebrate their successes in their own way. On a private slack channel, over a beer, or during lunch. Those are the real Retrospectives. You may be in some of those conversations, but by default, you will never (and should not aspire to be) in all of these conversations.

If you are a team member that feels this way, I empathize with your predicament. You can join the silent protest by going to my random Retrospective response generator at [link](https://brianngan.github.io/404.html "link") (_not done_). Let’s stand together is silent protest by offering more generic and plain-bread responses to quietly let the world know about the modern personal hell that is the Retrospective.
