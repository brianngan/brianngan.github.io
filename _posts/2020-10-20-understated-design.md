We inherit the designs of our time. For most designers in the here and now, we are, _whether we claim to be conscious of it or not_, complicit in propagating the designs of our time. 

These designs is a mix of the styles of contemporary tech companies (Airbnb, Apple, Slack, Invision, etc.), of popular frontend frameworks (Material UI, Bootstrap, iOS, etc.) and of UI trends (3D, Hand-drawn, Big Type seen on Behance or Dribbble).

I have an alternative that I have really come to like (This website follows this alternative), which is to design by subtraction. Nested in our day-to-day design decisions are a lot of blind assumptions and prescribed rules. By challenging these assumptions or rules, it opens up an opportunity to subtract and simplify. These are some websites that do it well:
