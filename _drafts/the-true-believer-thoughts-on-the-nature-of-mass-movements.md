title: 'The True Believer: Thoughts On The Nature Of Mass Movements'
categories: philosophy

Readers have two ways of interpreting the book. The kind interpretation is that the book warns readers of the cyclical nature of social revolutions, religious movements and nationalist movements; to warn readers that the prerequisites of mass movements are always there. The less kind interpretation is that the book provides a play-by-play for creating your first cult.

In the latter sense, this book is a must-read for aspiring sociopathic cult leaders (or just regular sociopathic business leaders).

The description of the potential convert coincides with the postmodernist idea of a person who commits philosophical suicide; i.e. a person who avoids the Absurdity of the search for meaning and gives in to living in bad faith. 

## The Appeal Of Mass Movements

Mass movements are based on three parts: A strong sense of discontent, an irresistible sense of power to change things and a faith in the future as a result of the change.

## Rebirth

The truth is that most of us are susceptible to looking outside ourselves for sudden and spectacular changes in our lives. The precarity and randomness of our lives  develops a natural deep feeling of insecurity. We look to put our faiths in an external power, as a substitute for the lost of faith in ourselves.

There is a fundamental difference between the appeal of a mass movement and the appeal of a practical organisation. The practical organisation offers opportunities for self-advancement, and its appeal is mainly to self-interest. A mass movement, particularly in its active, revivalist phase, appeals not to those intent on bolstering and advancing a cherished self, but to those who **seek to be rid of an unwanted self**.

A mass movement attracts and holds a following not because it can satisfy the desire for self-advancement, but because it can satisfy the passion for self-renunciation.

Applying this to product, the best products describe a legitimate source of discontent, and a persuasive promise that technology has and will change it.
