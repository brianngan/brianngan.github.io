## Short Development Time

This campaign was put together in a less than a week by the product and product marketing teams. In response to the COVID-19 situation, Genie Financial Services created a new Auto Financial Assistance Scheme to help small business and PHV drivers. And the short development time was crucial to capitalise on the press release date.

I designed the colour scheme and art style of the landing page and form; I also served as the product manager of the campaign; working closely with the product marketing stakeholders to get the marketing copy.

All in all, while the landing pages and forms are easy to execute, it was an enjoyable experience that allowed me to design something interesting and to create a channel to provide aid to small businesses.
