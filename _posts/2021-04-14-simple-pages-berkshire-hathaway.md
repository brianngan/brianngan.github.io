1This is part of my ongoing attempt to find simpler pages that solve real problems. ![](/uploads/screenshot-2021-04-14-174304.png)

Berkshire Hathaway's website is charmingly simple. It direct users to investor relation info so that he/she can make an investment decision. And from a UI perspective, it satisfies that goal well. And that makes it a good and simple piece of design.

Nonetheless, it is one quirky page; quirky at least by modern web standards. For one, it is pure HTML; no CSS. Also, it uses obscure elements like <dl>, <font> and <table> (think email templates). I guess these elements still hold up and the page renders in 2021.

In fact, I wonder if this website precedes CSS? If yes, then it has been chugging along for at least the last 25 years; quietly powering investment decisions amounting to $615 bn in market cap. Does that makes it's code better than 99% of applications or microsites? Most campaign microsites change in three months or less.  Most startup, let alone their applications, live and die in spans of less than 5 years. Those dead startup pages and completed marketing campaigns do nothing in the here and now; while this page still renders in 2021. It is definitely punching above it's weight-class in comparison to many shorter-lived pages - whatever 'better' may mean.

I imagine this is how the design brief for the site might have went:

> Dev: Hi Mr Buffett. Thanks for taking the time for this discussion. I've prepared a number of renditions and have my portfolio here for your reference. I've worked for clients ranging from XYZ brand to ABC brand. There's no website that I cannot build. Please feel free to let me know your thoughts and preferences.

Maybe I'm reading too deeply into this because of Bershire's halo effect. But I can't help but feel Warren Buffett's frugality _(think $3 macmuffin breakfasts)_ seeping into the design of the page. It shouts to a prospective investor that we're a company that is to-the-point, no-nonsense and really tight with our money (all traits of a good investment firm). Maybe that or... It was just 1994 and all websites looked like that.
