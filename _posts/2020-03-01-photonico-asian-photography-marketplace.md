## User Experience Case Study

### Product Discovery

My initial weeks involved speaking with a wide group of related audience types such as Photographers, Creatives, Librarians, etc. I decided to address the legitimate problem of finding good asian-centric stock photography. In general, competitors like Shutterstock, Getty Images or Unsplash have a very western-centric aesthetic. This means that most Singaporean creatives and marketers do private photo shoots in order to achieve the desired look and feel.

When shown some archival photos, I found that they fit a very narrow use case for creatives and marketers. This means that the success of the product would be contingent on bringing in the right set of photography that meets the broader use case of creatives and marketers.

With this primary problem statement, we decided to build a stock photography MVP and used the wealth of archival photos as a base, and then work on getting relevant photo contributions.

### Competitors

**Free images:** Unsplash, Pexels, Burst by Shopify, Moose

**Paid images:** Shutterstock, Getty Images, Adobe Stock, Pixerf, iStock

### Persona

Tom is an art director who frequently works with clients on Singapore/asian based marketing/microsite campaigns. He is tech savvy and particular about design. A pain point in his daily work is finding a relevant and high quality photo to use for his client’s campaign.

Carol is a news editor in a small publication and frequently files stories related to Southeast Asia. She understands social media and regularly acquires news from multiple sources. A pain point in her work is finding photos that capture a story since the publication’s reporters double up as photographers when in the field.

### Research

**Questions**

* When and why do you need to buy photos?
* How often do you buy photos and what are the common resources you use?
* What types of photos do you experience difficulty finding?
* What are you looking for in photos that you pay for?

**Findings**

* Users buy photos when creating artwork/website/advertisements for clients/inhouse
* Users have difficulty find niche and asian photos for clients
* Users tend to feel that stock photo sites have complicated payments and pricing structures
* Users tend to use Google to search for images, being agnostic to the stock image website unless their company has a subscription plan.
* Users tend not to be the paying customer, payment is mete by the design manager or lead.
* Users look for photos with clean composition, relevant emotions and facial expressions. They also prefer the fashion and looks in photos to be contemporary.
