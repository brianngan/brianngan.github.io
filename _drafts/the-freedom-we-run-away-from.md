title: The Freedom We Run Away From
categories: philosophy

---
One of the feelings that I have been experiencing is a certain meandering in life. A certain automatic stroll in my life trajectory, together with a sense of stagnation, or even retrograde. I feel like if life were a really long drive, I would be the teenager sulking in the backseat; smart enough to wear my seatbelt, but not smart enough to realise that there is nobody driving. 

Maybe it is the cabin fever getting to me. Maybe that is what characterises the mid career period in your life. My gut tells me that I am not alone in this sensibility. And if you feel this lost and meandering from time to time, then learning the ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre is for you.

The main idea proposed by Jean-Paul Sartre is that you are free. Yes, there are realities that are outside your control (facticities, as he calls it). But for the most part you are free. You are free to do whatever you want (radical freedom) with what has been done to you (facticity). For the most part, you are free to do an infinite permutations of things, and everyday, we don't. And there are two reasons for that.

## Most Of Your Choices Are Done On Autopilot

A lot of our life choices are done on autopilot (pre-reflective choices),

This week, I spent a few hours listening to a series of lectures on Existential Psychology from one of my favourite Youtube personalities, prof. Eric Dodson. I have been a fan of his Youtube introductory videos to key philosophical ideas. So when I found out that he was uploading his UWG lectures (they were made available online because of the COVID situation), I set aside my time to indulge in his lectures.

Do check the lectures out for yourself: [Jean-Paul Sartre Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5QP_A5BnmM&list=PL0gktz3rk0JDb36pab8mj7ZEAnzBymfXH "Jean-Paul Sartre Lecture Series")
